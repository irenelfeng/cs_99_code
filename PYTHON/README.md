I run python for caffe mainly. 

## Dependencies
To connect my matlab scripts to my python scripts, I installed a matlab engine for python 
For instructions to download the API go [here](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_external/install-the-matlab-engine-for-python.html)

# Test the mollahosseini network 
call `test_mollahosseini.py`

I also modified a FaceDetect algorithm from https://github.com/shantnu/FaceDetect
I performed it on FER so far. 61% of the faces have been registered.
